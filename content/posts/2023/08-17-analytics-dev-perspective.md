Hey, fellow developers! 👋 Here at dAppling, we've been harnessing the power of `@vercel/analytics` to keep our finger on the pulse of our site's performance. Every Monday, we're either celebrating a 'good' week or strategizing to turn a 'bad' week around. But we know that these insights aren't just valuable to us. That's why we've crafted something special for you: the **dappling-analytics package.** 🚀

#### Why dappling-analytics?

Because we know that analytics are crucial to understanding what's happening on your site, we wanted to offer something more than a one-size-fits-all solution. With dappling-analytics, you'll get:

- **Per-project statistics**: Track unique views and explore what specific pages people are visiting.
- **Easy integration**: Installation and configuration are a breeze, especially with React and NextJS projects.
- **Privacy preservation**: We care about user privacy as much as you do!

And all this comes with an easy-to-use interface right in the dappling app!

#### How to Get Started

1. **Installation via Your Favorite Package Manager**: Just like any other NPM package, installing dappling-analytics is simple: `npm install dappling-analytics` or `yarn install dappling-analytics`.

2. **Integration with React and NextJS**: Our `<Analytics />` component, built with React, makes integration seamless. Simply import it from our /react folder to access the component. If you're using other frameworks, a bit more configuration might be needed (but we're here to help!).

   `import { Analytics } from 'dappling-analytics/react'`

3. **Tracking Beyond Page Views**: Although we're starting with tracking page views and unique users, we're already planning to add more useful datapoints, such as customizable events.

4. **The Backend Stuff**: Our API endpoint and database storage are designed to make your analytics data easily accessible and interpretable.
